### What information is presented as facets
**Data source**: If configured so (relates to *installation/configuration*), one facet is returned for the **data source** (SDMX endpoint used to retrieve dataflow information).  

**One facet per localised CategoryScheme**: The localised CategoryScheme(s) in which the dataflow is categorised.  
**Note** that each dataflow can be attached to one or more than one category.  
The CategoryScheme can have a simple hierarchy (each child element can have no or only one parent element defined) of an undefined depth (usually not more than 3 or 4), e.g.:

![de facet hierarchy](/dotstatsuite-documentation/images/de-facet-1.png)

**One facet per concept that is used to define dataflow dimensions**: Concepts are distinguished only by their localised concept names (per language), not by their IDs.  
**Note** that all Concepts having the same localised name (independently from their ID) are grouped into one single facet.  

**Special concept facet for Frequency**.  
A dataflow can contain data for one or more frequencies that are normally defined through a frequency dimension. The specificity is that some dataflows with data of only one frequency might not have a frequency dimension, but it is also possible to find those dataflows through the frequency facet.  
In order to determine the frequency of data in such dataflows and add a relevant facet value for these, the search service do an additional unfiltered data query for one observation value.  
**Note** that if a dataflow has no time dimension, then it will also not have a value for the frequency facet.  

**Special concept facet for Time period**  
Dataflows do not have a codelist for the time period dimension (time dimension). Therefore, only the actual content constraint can be used to determine the available time periods and thus the values of the time period facet.  
For practical reasons, the search only allows a filter by **ANNUAL** time periods. All non-annual time periods are converted to annual time period facet values. The time period facet is built as a range facet, because the facet filtering is done through a start year and an end year.  
**Note** that if a dataflow has no time dimension, then it will also not have values for the time period facet.  

#### Indexation content restrictions

A dataflow is indexed **only if** there is data associated to it.  
The data availability check is based on the `Actual Content Constraint` attached to the dataflow. The dataflow is indexed only if there is:
- a non-empty Actual Content Constraint
- no Actual Content Constraint (for compatibility with SDMX web services not based on .Stat Suite).

A particular dimension of a dataflow is indexed only if the dimension values with available data do not exceed the limit defined in the SFS configuration parameter `DIMENSION_VALUES_LIMIT`, which is by default set to 1000. It protects the search engine from too big codelists and prevents performance impacts. For more information see [here](https://sis-cc.gitlab.io/dotstatsuite-documentation/configurations/de-configuration/#limit-for-indexing-dimensions-per-dataflow).  

Dimension values of a dataflow are indexed only if there are data available for the values or, if those values are hierarchical parents in case their children values have data. For that purpose, the search indexing takes the current `Actual Content Constraint` of the dataflow, if available, into account.

### How facets are used
#### Homepage facets
The localised .Stat DE home page presents a combination of a free text search box and a list of any few facets specifically defined in the [configuration](https://sis-cc.gitlab.io/dotstatsuite-documentation/configurations/de-configuration/) (in the currently chosen language) of the faceted search service. By configuration (see [here](https://sis-cc.gitlab.io/dotstatsuite-documentation/configurations/de-configuration/#auto-expanded-homepage-facet)), one facet can be expanded by default at page launch.

![de homepage facet](/dotstatsuite-documentation/images/de-facet-2.png)

Each facet, when opened, presents a selectable root-level of facet values together with a non-selectable second-level facet values. The root-level and second-level facet values represent the available values for all dataflows currently being indexed.  

> **Note** that, since the [August 25, 2020 Release .Stat Suite JS 5.3.0](https://sis-cc.gitlab.io/dotstatsuite-documentation/changelog/#august-25-2020) release, it is possible to make the individual second-level homepage facet values clickable by configuration. See the documentation [here](https://sis-cc.gitlab.io/dotstatsuite-documentation/configurations/de-configuration/#selectable-second-level-homepage-facet-values).

The free text search and the navigation through pre-defined facets are exclusive and result systematically in a new search discarding any previously made search selections.

#### Facets on the search result page
The facets shown in the search result page are fully dependent on the current search context.  
Common facet dimensions can be automatically removed (hidden) from the search result page when specifically defined in the [configuration](https://sis-cc.gitlab.io/dotstatsuite-documentation/configurations/de-configuration/).  
When browsing and filtering the search result content, only one facet can be expanded at a time. This also includes the 'Used filters' panel who is behaving as a facet. When refreshing the web browser, or when sharing a search result web page, the state of the currently expanded facet is kept in the URL.

![de facet result](/dotstatsuite-documentation/images/de-searchingdata-facets-searchresultpage.png)

**Impactless facets** (i.e. all of the facet values have a number of the related search results equal to the number of currently already available search results) are automatically hidden in order to not confuse users with selections that have no immediate effect on the number of search results.

#### Facet types
All facets are **multi-selection** facets (an existing facet value selection does not prevent selecting other still available facet values).  
*(since [October 5, 2021 Release .Stat Suite JS 10.0.0](https://sis-cc.gitlab.io/dotstatsuite-documentation/changelog/#october-5-2021))* Each item of a facet is displayed with a **checkbox** on the left side in the facet list:
- when the item is not selected, the checkbox is empty;
- when the item is not selected and the mouse hovers it, the checkbox stays empty and the background is blue;
- when the item is selected, the checkbox is changed into a tick mark.

![de facet checkbox](/dotstatsuite-documentation/images/de-facets-checkbox.png)

#### Facet information
The facet title contains the number of facet values available, and the number of currently selected facets (numbers surrounded by a frame). Whenever there is no facet value selection, then it is indicated by "all", e.g. `"all/38"`. When all the facet values are selected, the number of selected values is displayed instead, e.g. `"38/38"`.   
When there is no facet value selection, the items are not listed in the "used filters" area because no filtering is requested by the end-user.  

The facet values themselves show a number indicating the number of corresponding search results. Parent values contain the number of results valid for themselves and for all of their children.  

![de facet information](/dotstatsuite-documentation/images/de-searchingdata-facets-facetinformation.png)

#### Hierarchical contents
In case of a hierarchy in the dimension items, the facet displays the root parentsâ€™ list at first. A blue arrow next to an item and right-aligned indicates when this item is a parent of sub-item(s).  
If some of the root parents have children, then by clicking on the arrow, the children of this root parent will be displayed instead. The same behaviour is applied if some of the children also have a sub-children list.

#### Data availability

In hierarchical search facets, parent values, for which any of the resulting dataflows do not have data, are not selectable and are marked in light grey colour. Still, the user can navigate to the children and back to the parent again.

| Parents without data | Children of parents without data |

### Facet items ordered by explicit ORDER annotation
> Released in [July 8, 2021 Release .Stat Suite JS 9.0.0](https://sis-cc.gitlab.io/dotstatsuite-documentation/changelog/#july-8-2021)

Facet items displayed on the home and search result pages can be ordered according to the **explicit order** of the codes and categories using the *SDMX* **"ORDER" annotation** of data type integer, and according to the current locale: see more information **[here](https://sis-cc.gitlab.io/dotstatsuite-documentation/using-dlm/custom-data-view/implicit-explicit-order/)** about creating an ItemScheme with localised order(s).

In case an explicit "ORDER" annotation is provided for an item or items of a codelist returned as a facet of the DE, then this explicit order is applied to the home and search result facets.

**Localised and non-localised** order annotation types are both supported and applied, in the sense that the localised order value is applied first when provided, otherwise it is the non-localised order value if provided. 

In case of hierarchical facets, hierarchy always prevails over the explicit "ORDER" annotation, and explicit order is then applied in each level of the hierarchy independently from the other levels.

In case any two or more facet items have the same "ORDER" value, then these items are ordered 'naturally' based on hits. Note that the same "ORDER" values for different facet items are likely when several codelists are merged into the same facet (when the concept name is the same). Logically, the facet items are always first ordered by "ORDER" and then by hits.

In case an explicit "ORDER" annotation is not provided for an item, then this item is ordered as "0" value, and thus displayed first in the facet, before the ordered items.

**Example of an item of a codleisty with a localised "ORDER" value:**

```xml
  <structure:Code id="Y5-14">
    <common:Annotations>
      <common:Annotation>
        <common:AnnotationTitle>55</common:AnnotationTitle>
        <common:AnnotationType>ORDER</common:AnnotationType>
        <common:AnnotationText xml:lang="en">55</common:AnnotationText>
        <common:AnnotationText xml:lang="es">80</common:AnnotationText>
        <common:AnnotationText xml:lang="fr">85</common:AnnotationText>
      </common:Annotation>
    </common:Annotations>
    <common:Name xml:lang="en">5 to 14</common:Name>
    <common:Name xml:lang="es">5 a 14</common:Name>
    <common:Name xml:lang="fr">5 Ã  14</common:Name>
    <structure:Parent>
      <Ref id="_T"/>
    </structure:Parent>
  </structure:Code>
```  

**Example of a conbination of facets items with the same "ORDER" values, and combined with search hits:**

```txt
>* Aaa, Explicit order=5, Hit: 14
>* Bbb, Explicit order=4, Hit: 4
>* Ccc, Explicit order=3, Hit: 9
>* Ddd, Explicit order=3, Hit: 8
>* Eee, Explicit order=2, Hit: 11
>* Fff, Hit: 12
>* Ggg, Explicit order=1, Hit: 10
>* Hhh, Hit: 20  
>* Iii, Explicit order=1, Hit: 15
>* Jjj, Hit: 4
>
>Display order:
>* Hhh, Assumed order=0, Hit: 20
>* Fff, Assumed order=0, Hit: 12
>* Jjj, Assumed order=0, Hit: 4
>* Iii, Explicit order=1, Hit: 15
>* Ggg, Explicit order=1, Hit: 10
>* Eee, Explicit order=2, Hit: 11
>* Ccc, Explicit order=3, Hit: 9
>* Ddd, Explicit order=3, Hit: 8
>* Bbb, Explicit order=4, Hit: 4
>* Aaa, Explicit order=5, Hit: 14
```

### Used filters
The "Used filters" area in search resuslts displays all current selected items, per facet.  
The top right *green* numbering feature counts the total number of selected items for all facets.  
Used filters are ranked and displayed by facet type.  
Users can unselected:
* one single item by clicking on the `x` next to the item label, or
* all items for a given dimension by clicking on the `x` next to the dimension label, or finally 
* all selections by clicking on `Clear all filters`. When all filters are unselected, then the user is brought back to the home page.

To ease the readibility of the used filters when 15 or more items are selected in a facet, the display of the individual selected items is replaced by a number, the number of selected items of this facet.

### Pinned facets
Facets displayed with a [**.**] after their localised name are called **pinned facets** and are configured (the [configuration](https://sis-cc.gitlab.io/dotstatsuite-documentation/configurations/de-configuration/#search-results-page-pinned-facets) is set per DE instance) to always be displayed, when available, at the first top position(s) in the list.  
In addition, a help [**?**] tooltip is shown right next to the Filters header title, which displays the following information (localised): *"Filters marked with **.** are, when available, always listed first."*
