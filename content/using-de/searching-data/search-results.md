### Result content
The number of total search hits as well as the first set of most relevant search results are presented on the page.  

![de search result content](/images/de-result-1.png)

The following information is displayed for each result:
* The localised name
* The source (datasource ID)
* For each of the facets configured for the home page, the related localised facet value(s) and their parent hierarchy, e.g. `Topic: Health > Health Status`, `Source: ILO`
* The localised dataflow description
* The date/time of the last update of the dataflow
* The dataflowâ€™s Agency, ID and version

All the above details are "hidden" by default, and an option (arrow on the right side of the result name) allows the user to expand/collapse the detailed information for each result.  

A **download** button allowing downloading the complete unfiltered dataflow in SDMX-CSV format using the current language.

If a free text search was made, then the relevant above information is highlighted. If the text was found in a concept name/ID or dimension codes, then also this information is added to the dataflow information. See documentation on [How free text search hits are displayed](https://sis-cc.gitlab.io/dotstatsuite-documentation/using-de/searching-data/free-text-search/).

### Navigation towards the DE visualisation page
When the user selects a dataflow in the search result, by clicking on the search result, then she/he is forwarded to the DE data visualisation page that corresponds to that dataflow.  
The **filter selections are also kept** to the visualisation page that uses it to make the automated filter selections. For example, if the user has selected a reference area in the reference area facet of the search result page, then this selection is maintained in the reference area filter in the data visualisation page.
