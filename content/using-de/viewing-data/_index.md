This section describes the bahaviors and functionalities for viewing data, in what we call the Data Explorer **visualisation page**.  
In addition to the common header and footer of the Data Explorer ([Documentation](https://sis-cc.gitlab.io/dotstatsuite-documentation/using-de/general-layout/)), the visualisation page is composed of:
* **Filters** on the left side dynamically related to the data preview;
* a central **Data Preview** for table or chart representations;
* a **Toolbar** above the data preview with generic and contextual options;
* a **Back to the search results** option.

**Note** that the `Back to the search results` option is only available when the user is coming from a previous search result (see [this section](https://sis-cc.gitlab.io/dotstatsuite-documentation/using-de/searching-data/search-results/) of the documentation), and clicking on it brings the user back to any previous state of the search results.  
`Back to the search results` is not visible when opening a data preview from a shared URL, because in this case there will be no historical search results to go back to.
