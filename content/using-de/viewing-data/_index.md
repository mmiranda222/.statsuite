![Viewing data](/images/de-viewing-data.png)

This section describes the bahaviors and functionalities for viewing data, in what we call the Data Explorer visualisation pages.  
In addition to the common header and footer DE site, the visualisation page is composed of:
* **Filters** on the left side related to the data view;
* a central **Data Preview** table or chart;
* a **Toolbar** with generic and contextual options;
* a **Back to the search results** option.

#### Specificities
**Back to the search results**: this option is only available when the user is coming from a previous search result in the Data Explorer (see [this section](https://sis-cc.gitlab.io/dotstatsuite-documentation/using-de/searching-data/search-results/) of the documentation), and clicking on it brings the user back to any previous state of the search results.  
But, `Back to the search results` is not visible when, for instance, opening a data view from a shared URL, because there will be no historical search result path in that context.
