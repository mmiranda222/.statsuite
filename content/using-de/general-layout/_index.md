### User Interface Design

>**Disclaimer**: It is possible to see some differences between the principles of the UI design from the referenced documentation, and the look and feel of the latest versions of .Stat DE, this being due to the timing of implementation.  
Also, theming the Data Explorer is largely flexible (see our documentation [here](https://sis-cc.gitlab.io/dotstatsuite-documentation/configurations/de-customisation/) about the topic), you can thus meet tenants of the .Stat DE applying layouts, colors or fonts that are entirely different from the default ones.  

**.Stat Data Explorer UI design** and layouts are following and applying the principles described in the **[UI documentation](https://cis-itn-oecd.github.io/Design-artefacts/demo/ui-documentation/index.html)**.  
**[DE mockups](https://cis-itn-oecd.github.io/Design-artefacts/demo/de-material/index.html)** are also made and maintained up-to-date in order to illustrate how the design principles apply to the expected user experience.
