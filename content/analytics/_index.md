This page reports on .Stat Suite productivity metrics.  
It is a temporary solution for monitoring the .Stat Suite produciton cycle, before the new [GitLab Productivity Analytics feature](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/productivity_analytics.html) is fully implemented.  
The metrics displayed below were produced using [GitLab API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/README.html).
