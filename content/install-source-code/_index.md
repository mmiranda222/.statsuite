The following pages provides example topologies (with targetted infrastructures) and the related required .Stat Suite platform components (applications, services, libraries), which can be freely re-used to compose  new topology (system architecture) by anyone in its own infrastructure. Also included are the links to the related instructions for installaitons starting from the code base.  

This approach requires solid technical knowledge of the underlying ecosystems (.Net, MS SQL Server, JS, OS) but it offers most flexibility for topologies and configuration.  

Please see each page for more details:
