The following pages provide example topologies (with targetted infrastructures) and the related required .Stat Suite platform components (applications, services, libraries), which can be freely re-used to compose  new topology (system architecture) by anyone on their own infrastructure. Also included are the links to the related instructions for installations starting from the code base.  

This approach requires solid technical knowledge of the underlying ecosystems (.Net, MS SQL Server, JS, OS) but it offers the most flexibility for topologies and configuration.  

Please see each page for more details:

* [Full source code installation](/install-source-code/source-code)
* [Source code Windows installation example of .Stat Core services](/install-source-code/windows-stat-core-services)
* [Mono-tenant installation of .Stat DE services](/install-source-code/monotenant-install-from-artifacts)
* [Mono-tenant update of .Stat DE services](/install-source-code/monotenant-update-from-artifacts)
* [Mono-tenant update of .Stat DE services as Windows services](/install-source-code/monotenant-install-js-as-windows-services)

You can also have a look at the [Delivery stream's diagram](/getting-started/index/#delivery-streams-and-support-diagram) for a better understanding of the installation approach.
