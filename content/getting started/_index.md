### Delivery streams and support diagram

![DevOps diagram](/images/devops-schema.png)

In this diagram are represented 3 delivery approaches (in green) that we support and that are further described in the following sections of the web site:

* **DEV/DOCUMENTATION of source-code approach** refers to [Installation from source code](https://sis-cc.gitlab.io/dotstatsuite-documentation/install-source-code/) and sub-pages;
* **DEV/DOCKER IMAGES > DEV/DOCKER COMPOSE** refers to [Installation with Docker Compose](https://sis-cc.gitlab.io/dotstatsuite-documentation/install-docker/) and sub-pages;
*  **DEV/DOCKER IMAGES > DEV/KUBERNETES STRATEGIES** refers to [Installation from ready-made service package](https://sis-cc.gitlab.io/dotstatsuite-documentation/install-service/) and sub-pages.

In blue are represented the areas where some technical support can be provided by third-parties' technical partner(s) with the following tasks:

* Advanced support for source-code installations for technical experts (in collaboration with the Developer advocate);
* Support for source-code installations for technical newbies (creation of simple installation scripts, hand-holding);
* Advanced support for container-based installations (using Docker images) on premise (onsite/own cloud) for technical experts;
* Software as a Service (SaaS): host pilot, test of production instances.
