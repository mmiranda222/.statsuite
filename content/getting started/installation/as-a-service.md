We can propose a cloud computing solution of the .Stat Suite and delivered as a Service based on the **Software-as-a-Service "SaaS" model**.<br>
No need for locally hosting servers, building complex infrastructures or worrying about security plans:<br>
- The services are cloud computed and all applications and accesses are centrally maintained;<br>
- The model is designed to seamlessly integrate additional services into the stack when needed;<br>
- Costs and resources are minimised.<br>
