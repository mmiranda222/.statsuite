This page is a guide on how to setup, configure, customise and interact with most of the .Stat Data Explorer client-side configurations and (sdmx) business rules.<br>

These configurations are tasks to be performed by Administrators with access to the .Stat DE installation files, but they should all be driven by business decisions.<br>
Some of the whished configurations or settings (e.g. how to add a new sdmx public endpoint) are not available from here because they must happen in a previous step or they are refering to server-side decisions, and you should therfore refer to the [installation guides](https://sis-cc.gitlab.io/dotstatsuite-documentation/getting-started/installation/).
