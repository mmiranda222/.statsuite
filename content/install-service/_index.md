The following page provides information on how to easily deploy the .Stat Suite platform based on a fully-functional, ready-to-use service package, using a multi-tenant architecture.  
This eases cloud-hosting by any organisation for their own partners for test, demo, pilot or full-production purposes. Using this approach, we also provide cloud-hosting for [SIS-CC](https://siscc.org/) member organisations and their partners for test, demo and pilot purposes.  

This approach does not require developer skills, but it limits the configuration options.
