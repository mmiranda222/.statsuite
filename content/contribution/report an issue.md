## New issue
If you want to report an issue for any of the .Stat Suite applications, then you need to **open a new issue** into [Gitlab sis-cc/.stat-suite/issues](https://gitlab.com/groups/sis-cc/.stat-suite/-/issues).<br>
You can first try to find out if your issue (a bug, a new feature or a feature enhancement) has already been recorded.<br>

Any new issue needs to be created in a specific .Stat Suite project. The list being quite long, if you don't know to which specific service, tool or application to refer to, then go for the simplest, e.g. *dotstatsuite-data-explorer*.<br>

There are two types of issues you can create: whether you want to report a **bug**, or you want to suggest a **change** (a new feature or an improvement of an existing behavior).<br>
For each type, when creating the new issue, please add the related **gitlab label**: *bug* or *feature*. <br>

If you want to fix a bug yourself, then please refer to [How to contribute](https://sis-cc.gitlab.io/dotstatsuite-documentation/contribution/how-to-contribute/).<br>

## Writing a good issue
When reporting a **bug**:<br>
 - Describe what went wrong, what is the expected behavior and if relevant, what caused the problem;<br>
 - If it is not obvious, then list the steps to follow for someone else to reproduce the bug;<br>
 - Screenshots are sometimes very useful to understand the problem;<br>
 - In some cases (server-side errors, API queries, etc.), F12 console details or logs are extremely helpful.<br>

When suggesting a **feature**:<br>
 - Describe what you would expect to see as a user of the related application (e.g. "as a .Stat Data Explorer user, I want to be able to...");<br>
 - The full behavior and acceptance criteria will help understand the meaning of the feature;<br>
 - Give a clear description of the purpose of the feature, what is the outcome and added-value for the user.<br>
